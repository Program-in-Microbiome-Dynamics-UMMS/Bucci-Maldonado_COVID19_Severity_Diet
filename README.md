## ABSTRACT

SARS-CoV-2 positive patients exhibit gut and oral microbiome dysbiosis which is associated with various aspects of COVID-19 disease. However, little is known about the effect of artificial feeding (through a tube) on the microbiome dysbiosis of hospitalized or severely ill COVID-19 patients. We used random forest classification (RFC) machine learning models to determine whether specific members of microbiota found to be related to COVID-19 severity are cofounded by the feeding method during hospitalization. The gut, but not the oral microbiota, was a robust predictor of both COVID-19-related fatality and severity, with higher predictive value than most clinical variables. In addition, perturbations of the gut microbiota due to artificial tube feeding (enteral feeding) did not associate with species that were predictive of COVID-19 severity.
<br>**Importance:** SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to wide-ranging, systemic symptoms with sometimes unpredictable morbidity and mortality. It is increasingly clear that the human microbiome plays an important role in how individuals respond to viral infections. Our study adds to important literature about the associations of gut microbiota and severe COVID-19 illness during the early phase of the pandemic before the availability of vaccines. Increased understanding of the interplay between microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 may lead to innovations in diagnostics, therapies, and clinical predictions.
